This is a straighforward adaptation of Kociemba's Rubik's cube solving algorithm for Teensy 4.1. The solver consumes 4.3MB of flash memory (and optionally up to 700KB of RAM). 

On a Teensy 4.1, a randomly scrambled cube is solve with at most 24 moves under 1 second on average !

- The code was hacked from https://github.com/muodov/kociemba. 

- Check H. Kociemba's webpage http://kociemba.org/ for explanations about his beautiful algorithm.
